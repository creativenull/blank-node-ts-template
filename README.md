# Blank Node/Typescript Template
An opinionated blank template to get you started with node and typescript.

## Notes
This is just my way to writing node backend applications using typescript. I might add some other core libraries/modules
if I see them fit here. But the goal is to keep this template as clean as possible.

You are free to use this any way, even add/remove packages (like installing prettier, etc) you may like and create a
template to host on your own github.
